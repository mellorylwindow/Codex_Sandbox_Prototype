# Codex Sandbox Prototype

⚠️ **SANDBOX ONLY — DO NOT PROMOTE BY ACCIDENT**

This repo is a pure experiment zone. It is allowed to be messy, breakable, and temporary.

## Rules
- No dependencies on SwainLabs_Studios
- No hard links to SwainLabs paths
- Anything leaving this repo must be copied into SwainLabs intentionally (no accidental imports)

## Promotion Gate
Only move work into `/promote` if it has:
- a short README
- a minimal runnable example
- clean inputs/outputs (no machine-specific paths)
