# Codex Sandbox Prototype

⚠️ **SANDBOX ONLY — DO NOT PROMOTE BY ACCIDENT**

This repository is a **pure experimental sandbox**. It is intentionally allowed to be messy, breakable, and temporary.

## What this repo IS
- A place to spike ideas fast
- A scratchpad for prototypes and throwaway experiments
- A proving ground before anything graduates to SwainLabs_Studios

## What this repo is NOT
- **Not** SwainLabs_Studios
- **No** shared dependencies, imports, or hard links into SwainLabs_Studios
- **No** “just for now” code that later becomes production by inertia

## Promotion rule
Nothing leaves this repo unless it has:
- a short README explaining purpose + usage
- a minimal runnable example
- clean inputs/outputs (no hardcoded machine paths)
