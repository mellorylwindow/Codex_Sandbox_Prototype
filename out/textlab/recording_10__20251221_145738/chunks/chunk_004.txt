[21:03] which she was not able to do. What she's not able to do is separate the behaviors of her stepmother.
[21:12] They want to add some purposes. May as well be a Disney stepmother.
[21:17] She falls into the stereotype. She also falls into the stereotype of Carolynnn's parents, of being addicted to substance
[21:32] and conditioning in her previous experience before being a stepmother to Angel. So she's also a stepmother.
[21:40] So we all see the similarities, but comparing her to your stepmother is not helpful.
[21:51] Pivoting from that, I told Carolynnn that your life is your own. Your traumas are your own.
[22:01] Don't maybe people don't fully understand, but I end even I will admit I don't have the same
[22:12] experiences that you do. So my PTSD is different than hers. That's different from Mallow's. Mallow's
[22:20] comes from the school where she was abused and raped. Mine comes from the manipulation of people
[22:27] that I thought were family. That we're not blood slamming. And some of them that were.
[22:34] Perus comes from a deeper, darker place of abuse from her family, from her parents who are now longer dead.
[22:41] Now both dead, but she's still honors even though it's weird. It's a weird juxtaposition where you honor the
[22:50] abuser. She has shrines as it were to her mom and her dad in the corner, which you know, respectfully,
[23:01] that's fine. That's that's her thing, but she doesn't recognize that by doing that and maybe I'm wrong.
[23:10] She's honoring the abusers. She's not allowing herself to grow.
[23:16] Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. That's part of why I'm recording this. I'm looking for my own
[23:25] patterns and things that I do and things that I say and how I could reframe them to come from a place
[23:31] of healing and support and growth and not from shame, blame, manipulation. Those places, the shame,
[23:42] blame and manipulation. Occasionally, not on purpose, but I will do. I think also for her are
[23:58] involuntary responses that she has developed in her fight or flight.
[24:07] Over time, being abused in relationships, family, what have you?
[24:22] I don't want to start. Sorry, I probably already started. I don't want to continue
[24:33] to go down the path that she tries to go. It's very difficult because I am the mirror
[24:42] that I try to hand people. Instead of just handing people the mirror, I become the mirror
[24:49] and sometimes that's helpful and sometimes it's not. But sometimes it's a trap for me.
[24:59] So, when she starts using these coping mechanisms, these responses, I mirror her and it's hard
[25:10] for me to get across that that's what I'm doing because I recognize it. But, Carolynnn does not.
[25:20] So, when she hears that, and I'm mirroring her, she internalizes that. She takes it as an insult,
[25:31] as a slight, like, I'm not doing those things, you're doing those things. Going back to the blame shift.
[25:39] Whether she recognizes she's doing things or not, she has her own truth. As I tried to point out
[25:48] last night, everyone has their own truth. But the problem that I said last night was that she reviews
[25:56] as to acknowledge that any other truth could be true. I had to stay, had to rewind a statement that
[26:04] I made previously and I did to her and I said, in these arguments, you always have to be right.
