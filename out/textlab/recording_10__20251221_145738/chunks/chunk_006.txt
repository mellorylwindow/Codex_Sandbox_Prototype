[31:20] I don't think she's hearing that. I don't think she's hearing that. I tried to ask her last night.
[31:31] If, who, of the two of you, she thinks if we're in compare, people, mentally,
[31:41] has their shit together. I knew the answer she was going to get, right? Even though I didn't agree
[31:47] with it. And she said herself. I said okay. I didn't disagree or fight that. I acted as if I believed
[31:57] that was the case. I said okay, well if that's the case, then you should be able to have compassion.
[32:08] You should be able to see from the other person's perspective. If you believe you are stronger
[32:15] in that capacity, then if someone acts out, you need to step away. You need to be the better person.
[32:23] Now, I'm not seeing you do that. So, there's a disconnect.
[32:34] Let that count that for a little while. Now, we have an issue. Tomorrow.
[32:43] Tomorrow, I am taking Alam to the OBGYN to talk about getting a top surgery and talk about getting a
[32:59] hysterectomy. And for a regular visit, these are things that she's wanted since she was 17, 18,
[33:08] since she knew that it was possible for these things to happen since they're causing her pain
[33:12] in her life, which is adding to her mental health issues because she can't control these things.
[33:21] And then I am a man. I don't really understand what I'm doing the best that I can to help her out somewhere.
[33:29] The problem with that is that at 11.30, I need to drive Carolynnn to work.
[33:37] Today, I've given her a lot of money. Tomorrow, I will take her to work.
[33:46] And Mallow's appointment is in front of you.
[33:52] So, it would make sense if we could all be in the car together.
[33:58] We're going to need to all be in the car together.
[34:00] Tomorrow, tomorrow is not Friday. Mallow has already said that on Friday, things will be fine.
[34:10] She will keep to herself. If I can keep Carolynnn stable, we can do our thing, they can do their thing.
[34:20] I need to have a conversation with her tonight to see if that's possible. Tomorrow,
[34:26] because Carolynnn's work is not very far away.
[34:30] And her appointment is not very far away. But in doubling back, we may be late.
[34:40] So, I think she will see the sense in that. But I have until seven o'clock tonight when I pick up
[34:51] Carolynnn to work. To get that point across.
[34:58] Wish me luck. I'm almost at work now.
[35:06] So, I'm going to end this recording.
[35:13] Thank you for listening.
