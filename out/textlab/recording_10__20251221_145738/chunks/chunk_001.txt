[05:13] the spiral happens, she goes in there, you want a divorce, she throws that in there and it's a jab and it's,
[05:20] again, I think her demons are trying to get me. So, anyway, there's that one loop I would like to address
[05:35] within myself is, when I say we've been having this fight for three to four years, I'm trying to
[05:48] address something, but I can't articulate what I'm trying to say. So, I keep saying the same thing, I recognize that.
[06:00] What do I say? How do I say that in a healing way? This in a supportive way that also serves the purpose
[06:10] of bringing the pattern because it's a pattern. I just can't name the pattern.
[06:22] So, there's that. We addressed the bucket issue last night, you and I. Not Carolynnn and I, you and I.
[06:31] So, can we know that's an issue? Money is a very big trigger for me and it's a big trigger for her.
[06:41] It seems. However, while some of my points may be spot on my tone and the way I choose to phrase it
[06:52] are not right. I may be coming across as toxic and I may be coming across as gaslighted and manipulative
[07:08] and that's not my goal. My goal is I'm trying to keep us afloat and she's not hearing it. She's still spending
[07:17] like we have all the money in the world and then when she doesn't or when her funds get low and when I
[07:24] address this, she tries to shift the blame to a time in the apartment, which was not long ago,
[07:33] where she, I had given her the money to pay off her credit cards and she used that money mostly
[07:40] to buy food off of DoorDash. She tries to shift the blame to Mallow to Angel but ultimately as I've told her many
[07:49] times she has permission, she has the right and she needs to give herself permission to say no
[07:57] and also she needs to recognize that there is food in the house that we have addressed through doctors,
[08:05] her tremors and her tremors or because of a vilified, we've rolled that out, she no longer has tremors.
[08:12] She still has multiple health conditions. She has no billical parniath that's returned.
[08:19] She has scoliosis. She has PTSD. She has depression. She has anxiety.
[08:27] I'm categorizing like I could go to myself and say what? While unintentional, like I just said,
[08:43] I could be manipulative. I could be gaslighting. I don't mean to be that way but it's how I see the truth
[08:50] than it frustrates me that she does not. I need to look for more of these triggers
[09:08] in these conversations and try to address them. I think if I try to address them all one time
[09:14] it will overwhelm me and I will forget I'll get lost
[09:22] and I'll go right back to the loop. I don't want that. So when I started off this morning
[09:31] my conversation with Caro and consisted of telling her that which our value her
[09:38] was. Telling her about the tactic about what we're self-worth. Telling her about the patterns. Telling her I know
[09:49] about my behaviors. I'm very aware of my behaviors but I don't know how to stop them and that I am working on.
[09:57] And that I believe she can do with anything she sets her mind to, regardless of her physical or mental
[10:02] handicaps. I would like to help her work on her blame shifting. I would like to know if I also do that
[10:20] if I'm also guilty of shifting the blame because if I am I don't see it.
