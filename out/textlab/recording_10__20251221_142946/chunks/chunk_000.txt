I am driving to work today. Today is the 29th, I believe, on October and we had a big
fight last night. And so I had a few things. I thought about last night and I
said them this morning and I'm going to run them by this recording. Stop. I'm going to use a
great company. And then I'm going to analyze this later. So let's begin. Starting with Carolynn's
self-worth and going from there I said the first I'm going to give you a rule and I want you to
listen to me before you speak because it's not about them. It's about how we talk. I said that when you
start doubting your self-worth, when you start getting those suicidal thoughts, I want us to have a
hard sound for the conversation. I want us to sit in silence and reflection for at least one minute
before we continue talking. Because I value you and I respect you and I appreciate you more than
you know and more than you can see. I try to show you these things daily by little acts of kindness
because an acts of service because that's how I know to show love. But I don't ask for praise or
acknowledgement that I do these things because that's not why I do it. For example, last night, this is a
very simple example but it's probably perfect. She asked me to pick up some wine and some beer. So on the way, I stopped at
Harris Teter which is across the street in the same way near my work because I know that they keep their
alcohol cold and I know that she prefers it cold. I mean who does it with my shirt? That's the thing, right? So I went there and I got the
beer that she likes, the type of that particular brand that she likes, the wine that she likes, the type of
particular one that she likes and I got them both cold. Alright, that too me getting her dressed daily, me helping
her tuck her in the bed, me, you know, helping her out of the shower, all of that. That's all acts of kindness. So there's that.
Let's see. What else did I want to talk about? I just said it also perfectly in there and of course I didn't have the
microphone recording because of the way up. I recognize for the both of us that we are stuck in loops, we are stuck in
patterns that are not serving either one of us. I said that it is possible. It is in the realm of possibility that while abstract her
demons, when we're fighting, I believe are coming over to my brain and whispering in my ear and because they want
to see her melt down, they want to see her break. I don't want the same thing her demons do. I said keep in mind I realized that is kind
of abstract and silly, but it helps paint the picture. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. Let's see. I need to find key triggers. This is
me just talking and things that I say and things that she says because this whole mission is about personal growth and I want us to
grow together as a couple, as a married couple. I didn't marry her for no reason. This week has been the first time in a fight and I
have straight out, without set up on a divorce. Previously in the past three years, every time I get into a fight, when this spiral happens, she goes in there, you want a
divorce, she throws that in there and it's a jab and it's again, I think her demons trying to get me. Anyway, there's that one
loop I would like to address within myself is when I say we've been having the same fight for three to four years, I'm trying to address something, but I can't
articulate what I'm trying to say, so I keep saying the same thing. I recognize that. When do I say it? How do I say that in a healing way? This is in a supportive way that also
observes the purpose of bringing the pattern because it's a pattern. I just can't name the pattern.
So, there's that. We addressed the bucket issue last night, you and I, not Carolynn and I, you and I, so we know that's an issue. Money is a very big trigger for me.
And it's a big trigger for her. It seems. However, while some of my points may be spot on my tone, and the way I choose to phrase it, are not right. I may be coming across as toxic and I may be coming across as gas.
Damn, I can't talk across as gaslighted and manipulative. And that's not my goal. My goal is I'm trying to keep us afloat, and she's not hearing it. She's still spending like we have all the money in the world. And then when she doesn't, or when her funds get low and when I address this, she tries to shift the blame to a time in the apartment, which was not long ago.
Where she, I had given her the money to pay off her credit cards, and she used that money mostly to buy food off of DoorDash. She tries to shift the blame to Malau, to Angel, but ultimately, as I've told her many times, she has permission, she has the right, and she needs to give herself permission to say no. And also she needs to recognize that there is food in the house for her.
That we have addressed through doctors, her tremors, and her tremors, or because of a billified, we've rolled that out. She no longer has tremors. She still has multiple health conditions. She has no billical parniath that's returned. She has scoliosis, she has PTSD, she has depression, she has anxiety.
I'm categorizing, like I could go to myself and say, what? While unintentional, like I just said, I could be manipulative, I could be gaslighting. I don't mean to be that way, but it's how I see the truth, and it frustrates me that she does not.
I need to look for more of these triggers in these conversations and try to address them. I think if I try to address them all at one time, it will overwhelm me, and I will forget. I'll get lost.
And I'll go right back to the loop. I don't want that. So when I started off this morning, my conversation with Carolynn consisted of telling her I value her, telling her of the tactic.
About myself worth telling her about the patterns, telling her I know about my behaviors. I'm very aware of my behaviors, but I don't know how to stop them, and that I am working on them.
And that I believe she can do anything she sets her mind to, regardless of her physical or mental handicaps.
I would like to help her work on her blame shifting. I would like to know if I also do that, if I'm also guilty of shifting the blame, because if I am, I don't see it.
I still have 26 minutes before I get to work. One of the concessions I made last night was that she needed to go to work today, and I have to be in the office.
So I gave her $40 to take a lift to get there. I can still pick her up tonight. I saw a little mantra or whatever you want to say. Call it. You remember you gave in the mantra.
Anyway, to put myself in better alignment with abundance and flow. I have started using these affirmations, what have you, and addressing a higher power.
While I will not call that power god, I recognize that that's probably what it is. That's probably what the rest of society is calling god.
I have started to understand with affirmations and comparing them to what prayers might look like, coming in my mouth, and how they might be genuine.
Now they might be the same thing. I have decided to refer to quote-unquote god as either player one or lord, because sometimes it's vetic to say lord. I don't know why that is, but it just seems like it's correct.
I would like to recognize, and this is off the point completely, that I, man, I need a better word than pray or affirmation, but I prayed yesterday in the car, or I said affirmations, and I expressed gratitude for the things that it did receive as I received them.
And I looked for ways that those quote-unquote prayers were answered. And I gave thanks every time, that I recognized, and I saw the gift of returning, and putting me more of them.
Sometimes to myself, my head sometimes out loud, but I didn't think anyone was listening.
This is very hard. But I'm doing it now in the car, because I only have this voice recorder that is listening, which is suspect, but that's alright, because if I do, like I did with the conversation with Paul, and the fight from last night, I think that these confessions, reflections, could be extremely beneficial.
So I know I don't want to work on everything at the same time. I know I just said that, but I don't want to hit stop and start all that.
So I'm going to address another issue, which is kind of the same issue. It's part of the bigger issue, right now because of the fight that we had that's been going on for about a week now.
Malau is not talking to Carolynn. She barely is talking to me, but that's alright, because here's what I try to explain to Carolynn.
It wasn't the boundary that set Malau off. It was the statement after she accepted, after the boundary she tried to set up, of saying that she shouldn't bother.
And she goes on to say she didn't know, but really you can read in the tone unless you're completely tone blind, which she might be. I might just be missing that.
I over-tone, and she is blind to tone, I think. So I think there's a disconnect there. But anyway, ultimately what happened was three days after Malau had told us both to hang ourselves.
She, she told me three days later, she said in person, you know, she scared herself a lot, that just goes to show how far she was driven past the successes and the progress she's already made, that it drove her to that point.
I have told Carolynn that Malau's continued silence is her way of respecting boundaries and not triggering herself, because she recognizes that Carolynn can be a trigger. And like me, she doesn't know how to deal with that.
So I'm trying to work with both of them and with myself. Angel seems to be fairly receptive to any direction I give her, which is nice. Even if she doesn't like it, I'm quick to tell her that I'm not coming out of a place of shame or blame or anything like that with her.
Or if I tell her something, for one, it is strictly confidential between the two of us. And the reason for that is the other two cannot handle the information. Not in its raw-on filter.
So, we have to understand. Sometimes I have to course corrupt. Sometimes, for instance, last night, in the chat, Angel was frustrated with the door dash driver, and in the chat, while, you know, with Talo and her cursing isn't a big deal.
But, in Carolynn's generation, well, I'm at the end of Carolynn's generation. She's 1973, I'm 1979. So there's a little bit of a generation issue there. But I said to Angel, please, in the chat, I recognize how comfortable you are with language, and it isn't an issue for you.
I recognize your restraint at work, how you respect the chain of command, and you ask if you have permission to speak freely sometimes, because things are frustrating. And you are an adult, and that is perfect. That is the way to do that.
However, in the chat between myself and Carolynn, because Malo has left the chat, that may be permanent, that may be temporary, we don't know. However, I would like her to keep a PG in the chat.
It avoids conflicts and misunderstanding. And it's a small request. After a brief puff and slight attempt at a rebundal from Angel, and I have to go in this traffic circle again.
I went to Angel, and I said, Angel, look, sometimes, you have to sacrifice the battle. You have to lose the smaller fights in order for the greater goal.
In this game of things, this battle is not important. What I would like you to do, be speaking to Angel, is I would like you to try to step back and replicate when fighting something.
Hold on, further your thoughts. When I need you to recognize that we are not even going to try to hold you back, if nothing else, I have not been able to hold you back.
I decided I made the decision to go to India to get you to bring you here, to change your purpose. It was my decision to make that final goal.
I made no threats about sending you back to India. I don't care when my friend did that, which we chose to power trip with that.
I know how beneficial the relationship is between her and her. I've seen the growth of Angel, since she's moved here.
Since she's been here, she's got two jobs. One was her first job, and it was like a practice job at Giant. Now she's working at Einstein Bagels.
She's working a lot on her hours, or consistently doing things, trying more things, building confidence in herself. She's able to admit her truth to her family, whether her family accepts her or not.
When she was not able to do, what she's not able to do is separate the behaviors of her stepmother.
Her own debts and purposes may as well be a Disney stepmother. She falls into the stereotype. She also falls into the stereotype of Caroline's parents, of being addicted to substance.
And conditioning, in her previous experience before being a stepmother to Angel. So she's also a stepmother.
So we all see the similarities, but comparing her to your stepmother is not helpful.
Pivoting from that, I told Caroline that your life is your own. Your traumas are your own.
Maybe people don't fully understand, but even I will admit, I don't have the same experiences that you do.
So my PTSD is different than hers. That's different from Malo's. Malo's comes from the school where she was abused and raped.
Mine comes from the manipulation of people that I thought were family, that were not bloodflamers. And some of them that were.
Perus comes from a deeper, darker place of abuse from her parents who are now longer dead. Now both dead, but she still honors even though it's weird.
It's a weird juxtaposition where you honor the abuser. She has shrines as it were to her mom and her dad in the corner.
Which, you know, respectfully, that's fine. That's her thing. But she doesn't recognize that by doing that.
And maybe I'm wrong. She's honoring the abusers. She's not allowing herself to grow. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm really wrong.
That's part of why I'm recording this. I'm looking for my own patterns and things that I do and things that I say and how I could reframe them to come from a place of healing and support and growth and not from shame, blame, manipulation.
Those places, the shame, blame, manipulation. I occasionally, not on purpose, but I will do. I think also for her are involuntary responses that she has developed in her fight or flight.
Over time, being abused in relationships, family. What have you? Excuse me. I don't want to start. Sorry, I probably already started. I don't want to continue to go down the path that she tries to go.
It's very difficult because I am the mirror that I try to hand people instead of just handing people the mirror. I become the mirror.
And sometimes that's helpful. And sometimes it's not. But sometimes it's a trap for me.
So when she starts doing using these coping mechanisms, these responses, I mirror her. And it's hard for me to get across that that's what I'm doing because I recognize it.
But Carolynn does not. So when she hears that, I'm mirroring her. She internalizes that. She takes it as an insult, as a slight, like, I'm not doing those things. You're doing those things.
Going back to the blame shift. Whether she recognizes she's doing things or not, she has her own truth. As I tried to point out last night, everyone has their own truth.
But the problem that I said last night was that she refuses to acknowledge that any other truth could be true. I had to rewind a statement that I made previously. And I did to her. And I said, in these arguments, you always have to be right.
I said that statement was wrong. She was right to correct me that she doesn't have to be right. However, my belief is that she lives in a certain truth.
Non-deniable truth to her. She believes that it is what it is. The sky is blue, the grass is green. However, she's not open to the possibility, at least not in her current state, that there is another way that other people might actually have a point.
So another issue that I see is that going back to the PTSD, the trauma, the life experiences. She continues to let all of that define her as who she is.
She has admitted she does not love herself. She finds herself disgusting. But she also, as I am adding a note to that, is in a pit of despair. And she can't see outside of her.
I am really trying to help her develop her own self-worth and self-love. And to me, that is more important than our relationship. Because our relationship, without that, since I am now beginning to love myself, beginning to value myself and standing up before myself.
And I point at that out to her, without not standing up before me. I'm not standing up for danger, I'm not standing up for her. I'm standing up for myself because I refuse to tolerate this kind of bullshit in our relationship in my life.
Oh, that's a lot. So, here's another one. Here's another one.
Oh, man, this is hard. I'm trying to find the words here. So, woof. All right. So our biggest issue, our biggest fight. Yes, money is a huge issue. We're working on that. We've named that with the bucket.
At least you and I have. His mother. Whether she admits it or not. Whether she's conscious of it or not. Though I've tried to make her conscious. And she just deflects and deflects it.
Well, I have her personal reflection time on this. Is that the way she expects me to handle relationship with her and Mala is asked if I were both of their father.
It's been pointed out to me by ageing that Carolynn may be jealous of the relationship between her and Mala myself because it's a relationship that she could not have with her mother when she was robbed of her mother, but having any chance of that.
Carolynn refuses to see the truth. I see it completely, but I don't think it's the truth. These things are complicated. Like we said yesterday. She argues out of emotion. I argue out of emotion.
And sometimes when I argue out of the object, since that's where I'm going. That's where I give no proof. That's where I stand in my stance because I'm simply stating that we need to do.
I've got a signing plan. She is internalizing the facts that I say and making them out of here, directing them. You know, as as condolences of herself.
I don't know how to prank things other ways.
So when she's trying to get me to do something, get me to tell Mala something and I think it's irrational because I know it will trigger Mala in the way that she wants to do it.
I don't think she's hearing that. I don't think she's hearing that. I tried to ask her last night.
If who of the two of you she thinks if we're compared people mentally has their shit together. I knew the answer. She was going to get right even though I didn't agree with it. She said herself. I said, OK. I didn't disagree or fight that.
I acted as if I believed that was the case. I said, OK. Well, if that's the case, then you should be able to have compassion. You should be able to see from the other person's perspective.
If you believe you are stronger in that capacity, then if someone acts out, you need to step away. You need to be the better person.
Now I'm not seeing you do that. So there's a disconnect. Let that count there for a little while.
Now, we have an issue tomorrow. Tomorrow I am taking Mala to the OBGYN to talk about getting a top surgery and talking about getting a hysterectomy.
And for a regular visit, these are things that she's wanted since she was 17, 18. Since she knew that it was possible for these things to happen since they're causing her pain in her life, which is adding to her mental health issues because she cannot control these things.
And then I am a man. I don't really understand what I'm doing the best that I can to help her. The problem is that at 11.30, I need to drive carelessly to work. Today I've given her one. Tomorrow, I will take her to work.
And Mala's appointment is a punishment. So it would make sense if we could all be in the car together.
We're going to need to all be in the car together for Marcos on Friday. Mala has already said that on Friday, things will be fine.
She will keep to herself. If I can keep Carolynn stable, we can do our thing. They can do their thing. I need to have a conversation with her tonight to see if that's possible. Tomorrow.
Because Carolynn's work is not very far away. And her appointment is not very far away. But in doubling back, we may be late.
So I think she will see the sense in that. But I have until seven o'clock tonight when I pick up Carolynn to work to get that point across. Wish me luck.
I'm almost at work now. So I'm going to end this recording. Thank you for listening.
