[10:25] I still have 26 minutes before I get to work. One of the concessions I made last night was that
[10:40] she needed to go to work today and I have to be in the office, right? So I gave her $40 to get there.
[10:53] I can still pick her up tonight. I saw a little mantra or a little whatever you want to say.
[11:03] Call it. You remember you gave in the mantra. Anyway,
[11:09] to put myself in better alignment with abundance and flow.
[11:13] I have started using these affirmations would have you in addressing a higher power.
[11:25] While I will not call that power God, I recognize that that's probably what it is. That's probably what
[11:33] the rest of society is calling God. I have started to understand with affirmations and comparing
[11:42] to what prayers might look like. Coming in my mouth and how they might be genuine.
[11:50] Now they might be the same thing.
[11:54] I've decided to refer to quote unquote God as either player one or lord because sometimes it's
[12:06] fitting to say the word. I don't know why that is but it just seems like it's correct.
[12:19] I would like to recognize, and this is off the point completely, that I,
[12:28] man, I need a better word than pray or affirmation but I prayed yesterday in the car or I said
[12:34] affirmations and I expressed gratitude for the things that it did receive as I received them.
[12:45] And I looked for ways that those quote unquote prayers were answered.
[12:51] And I gave thanks every time that I recognized and I saw the gift of returning and putting me more
[13:00] up. Sometimes to myself, my head, sometimes out loud, but I didn't think anyone was listening.
[13:14] This is very hard. But I'm doing it now in the car because I only have this voice for
[13:23] quote that is listening, which is suspect, but that's all right because if I do, like I did with the
[13:31] conversation with Paul and the fight from last night, I think that these confessions, reflections
[13:41] could be extremely beneficial.
[13:47] So I know I don't want to work on everything at the same time. I know I just said that,
[13:52] but I don't want to hit stop and start all that. So I'm going to address another issue which is
[13:59] kind of the same issue. It's part of the bigger issue right now because of the fight that we had
[14:08] that's been going on for about a week now.
[14:10] Malau is not talking to Carolynnn. She barely is talking to me, but that's all right because
[14:28] here's what I try to explain to Carolynnn. It wasn't the boundary that sent
[14:36] Malau off. It was the statement after she accepted, after the boundary she tried to send
[14:45] of saying that she shouldn't bother. And she goes on to say she didn't know, but really you can read in
[14:52] the tone unless you're completely tone blind, which she might be. I might just be missing that.
[14:59] I over-tone and she is blind to tone, I think. So I think there's a disconnect there.
[15:12] But anyway, ultimately what happened was three days after Malau had told us both to hang ourselves.
[15:21] She, she told me three days later, she said in person. She scared herself a lot that just goes to show
[15:39] how far she was driven past the successes and the progress she's already made that had drove her to that
