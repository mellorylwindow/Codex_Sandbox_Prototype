- Starting with Carolyn's self-worth and going from there I said the first I'm going to give you a rule and I want you to listen to me before you speak because it's not about them.
- Previously in the past three years, every time I get into a fight, when this spiral happens, she goes in there, you want a divorce, she throws that in there and it's a jab and it's again, I think her demons trying to get me.
- Anyway, there's that one loop I would like to address within myself is when I say we've been having the same fight for three to four years, I'm trying to address something, but I can't articulate what I'm trying to say, so I keep saying the same thing.
- But I'm doing it now in the car, because I only have this voice recorder that is listening, which is suspect, but that's alright, because if I do, like I did with the conversation with Paul, and the fight from last night, I think that these confessions, reflections, could be extremely beneficial.
- It's part of the bigger issue, right now because of the fight that we had that's been going on for about a week now.
- I have told Carolyn that Malau's continued silence is her way of respecting boundaries and not triggering herself, because she recognizes that Carolyn can be a trigger.
- When I need you to recognize that we are not even going to try to hold you back, if nothing else, I have not been able to hold you back.
- However, she's not open to the possibility, at least not in her current state, that there is another way that other people might actually have a point.
- It's been pointed out to me by ageing that Carolyn may be jealous of the relationship between her and Mala myself because it's a relationship that she could not have with her mother when she was robbed of her mother, but having any chance of that.
- So when she's trying to get me to do something, get me to tell Mala something and I think it's irrational because I know it will trigger Mala in the way that she wants to do it.
