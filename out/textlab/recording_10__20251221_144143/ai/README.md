# TextLab AI Scaffold — recording_10__20251221_144143

This folder is **offline scaffolding** for later AI-assisted work.

## Suggested workflow
1) Open TOC.md and pick a chunk.
2) Use the chunk text as input to your AI tool of choice.
3) Save outputs here, e.g.:

- `ai/chunk_000.summary.md`
- `ai/chunk_000.rewrite.md`
- `ai/chunk_000.story.md`

## Task list
- See `tasks.json` for per-chunk suggested operations.
