[00:00] I am driving to work today. Today is the 29th, I believe, on October and we had a big
[00:19] fight last night and so I had a few things. I thought about last night and I
[00:28] said them this morning and I'm going to run them by this recording. Stop. I'm going to use a great
[00:39] couple. And then I'm going to analyze this later. Let's begin. Starting with Carolynn's self-worth
[00:54] and going from there I said the first I'm going to give you a rule and I want you to listen to
[01:06] me before you speak because it's not about them. It's about how we talk. I said that when you start
[01:15] doubting your self-worth, when you start getting those suicidal thoughts, I want us to have a hard
[01:24] sound to the conversation. I want us to sit in silence and reflection for at least one minute before
[01:31] we continue talking because I value you and I respect you and I appreciate you more than you know
[01:38] and more than you can see. I try to show you these things daily by little acts of kindness because
[01:50] and acts of service because that's how I know to show love. But I don't ask for praise or acknowledgement
[02:06] that I do these things because that's not why I do it. For example, last night, this is a very simple
[02:15] example, but it's probably perfect. She asked me to pick up some wine and some beer. So on the way,
[02:23] I stopped at Harris Teter which is across the street in the same way near my work because I know that
[02:31] they keep their alcohol cold and I know that she prefers it cold. I mean, who does it? That's the thing,
[02:37] right? So I went there and I got the beer that she likes, the type of the of that particular brand that
[02:46] she likes, the wine that she likes, the type of particular one that she likes, and I got them both cold.
[02:53] All right. That too, me getting her dressed daily, me helping her tuck her in the bed, me, you know,
[03:03] helping her out of the shower. All of that. That's all acts of kindness. So there's that.
[03:13] Let's see. What else did I want to talk about? I just said it also perfectly in there and of course,
[03:22] I didn't have the microphone recording, except for me. I recognize for the both of us that we are stuck
[03:38] in loops, we are stuck in patterns that are not serving either. One of us, I said that it is possible,
[03:47] it is in the realm of possibility that while abstract her demons, when we're fighting, I believe are coming
[04:02] over to my brain and whispering in my ear and because they want to see her melt down, they want to see her
[04:09] break. I don't want the same thing her demons do. I said keep in mind, I realized that is kind of abstract
[04:20] and silly, but it helps paint the picture. Let's see, let's see, let's see. I need to find key triggers.
[04:37] This is me just talking to them and things that I say and things that she says because this whole
[04:46] mission is about personal growth and I want us to group together as a couple, as a married couple.
[04:53] I didn't marry her for no reason. This week has been the first time in a fight that I have straight
