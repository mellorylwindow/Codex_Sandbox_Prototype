[15:21] She, she told me three days later, she said in person. She scared herself a lot that just goes to show
[15:39] how far she was driven past the successes and the progress she's already made that had drove her to that
[15:50] point. I have told Carolynn that Malau's continued silence is her way of respecting boundaries and not
[16:04] triggering herself because she recognizes that Caro could be a trigger. And like me, she doesn't know how
[16:13] to deal with that. So I am trying to work with both of them and with myself. Angel seems to be fairly
[16:25] receptive to any direction I give her, which is nice. Even if she doesn't like it, I'm quick to tell her
[16:34] that I'm not coming out of a place of shame or blame or anything like that with her. If I tell her something
[16:46] for one, it is strictly confidential between the two of us. And the reason for that is the other two cannot
[16:54] handle the information, not in its raw on filter. So we have to understand. Sometimes I have to course
[17:07] Caro. Sometimes, for instance, last night in the chat, Angel was frustrated with a door dash driver
[17:17] and in the chat, wow, you know, with Caro and her cursing is in a big deal, right? But
[17:30] in Carolynn's generation, well, I'm at the end of Carolynn's generation. She's 1973, I'm 1979.
[17:37] So there's a little bit of a generation issue there. But I said to Angel, please in the chat, I
[17:50] recognize how comfortable you are with language and it isn't an issue for you and it isn't an issue for
[17:57] Mala. Work for most people. I recognize your restraint at work, how you respect the chain of command
[18:07] and you ask if you have permission to speak freely sometimes because things are frustrating.
[18:13] And you are an adult and that is perfect. That is the way to do that. However, in the chat between myself,
[18:22] her and Carolynn, because Mala is left the chat, that may be permanent, that may be temporary, we don't know.
[18:33] However, I would like her to keep a BG in the chat. It avoids the godly goodness understanding.
[18:44] And I just get a small request. After a brief puff, slight attempt to re-bundle from Angel and I have to
[18:59] go in this traffic circle again. I went to Angel and I said Angel, look, sometimes you have to sacrifice the battle.
[19:14] You have to lose the smaller fights in order for the greater goal.
[19:21] In this game of things, this battle is not important. What I would like you to do,
[19:30] may speak in age or sentence, it's hard like you to try to step back and recognize when fighting something.
[19:38] I need you to recognize that we are not even going to try to hold your back.
[19:52] If nothing else, I have not anyone to hold your back. I decided I made the decision to go to India
[20:01] to get you to bring you here, to change your path. That was my decision to make that final goal.
[20:09] I make no threats about sending you back to India, though Carolynn might try to do that, which we chose to power trip with that.
[20:19] I know how an efficient relationship is between her and Mala and I have seen the growth of Angel,
