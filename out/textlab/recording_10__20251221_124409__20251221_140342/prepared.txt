[00:00] I am driving to work today. Today is the 29th, I believe, on October and we had a big
[00:19] fight last night and so I had a few things. I thought about last night and I
[00:28] said them this morning and I'm going to run them by this recording. Stop. I'm going to use a great
[00:39] couple. And then I'm going to analyze this later. Let's begin. Starting with Carolynn's self-worth
[00:54] and going from there I said the first I'm going to give you a rule and I want you to listen to
[01:06] me before you speak because it's not about them. It's about how we talk. I said that when you start
[01:15] doubting your self-worth, when you start getting those suicidal thoughts, I want us to have a hard
[01:24] sound to the conversation. I want us to sit in silence and reflection for at least one minute before
[01:31] we continue talking because I value you and I respect you and I appreciate you more than you know
[01:38] and more than you can see. I try to show you these things daily by little acts of kindness because
[01:50] and acts of service because that's how I know to show love. But I don't ask for praise or acknowledgement
[02:06] that I do these things because that's not why I do it. For example, last night, this is a very simple
[02:15] example, but it's probably perfect. She asked me to pick up some wine and some beer. So on the way,
[02:23] I stopped at Harris Teter which is across the street in the same way near my work because I know that
[02:31] they keep their alcohol cold and I know that she prefers it cold. I mean, who does it? That's the thing,
[02:37] right? So I went there and I got the beer that she likes, the type of the of that particular brand that
[02:46] she likes, the wine that she likes, the type of particular one that she likes, and I got them both cold.
[02:53] All right. That too, me getting her dressed daily, me helping her tuck her in the bed, me, you know,
[03:03] helping her out of the shower. All of that. That's all acts of kindness. So there's that.
[03:13] Let's see. What else did I want to talk about? I just said it also perfectly in there and of course,
[03:22] I didn't have the microphone recording, except for me. I recognize for the both of us that we are stuck
[03:38] in loops, we are stuck in patterns that are not serving either. One of us, I said that it is possible,
[03:47] it is in the realm of possibility that while abstract her demons, when we're fighting, I believe are coming
[04:02] over to my brain and whispering in my ear and because they want to see her melt down, they want to see her
[04:09] break. I don't want the same thing her demons do. I said keep in mind, I realized that is kind of abstract
[04:20] and silly, but it helps paint the picture. Let's see, let's see, let's see. I need to find key triggers.
[04:37] This is me just talking to them and things that I say and things that she says because this whole
[04:46] mission is about personal growth and I want us to group together as a couple, as a married couple.
[04:53] I didn't marry her for no reason. This week has been the first time in a fight that I have straight
[05:04] out and set up on a divorce. Previously in the past three years, every time I get into a fight, when
[05:13] the spiral happens, she goes in there, you want a divorce, she throws that in there and it's a jab and it's,
[05:20] again, I think her demons are trying to get me. So, anyway, there's that one loop I would like to address
[05:35] within myself is, when I say we've been having this fight for three to four years, I'm trying to
[05:48] address something, but I can't articulate what I'm trying to say. So, I keep saying the same thing, I recognize that.
[06:00] What do I say? How do I say that in a healing way? This in a supportive way that also serves the purpose
[06:10] of bringing the pattern because it's a pattern. I just can't name the pattern.
[06:22] So, there's that. We addressed the bucket issue last night, you and I. Not Carolynn and I, you and I.
[06:31] So, can we know that's an issue? Money is a very big trigger for me and it's a big trigger for her.
[06:41] It seems. However, while some of my points may be spot on my tone and the way I choose to phrase it
[06:52] are not right. I may be coming across as toxic and I may be coming across as gaslighted and manipulative
[07:08] and that's not my goal. My goal is I'm trying to keep us afloat and she's not hearing it. She's still spending
[07:17] like we have all the money in the world and then when she doesn't or when her funds get low and when I
[07:24] address this, she tries to shift the blame to a time in the apartment, which was not long ago,
[07:33] where she, I had given her the money to pay off her credit cards and she used that money mostly
[07:40] to buy food off of DoorDash. She tries to shift the blame to Mallow to Angel but ultimately as I've told her many
[07:49] times she has permission, she has the right and she needs to give herself permission to say no
[07:57] and also she needs to recognize that there is food in the house that we have addressed through doctors,
[08:05] her tremors and her tremors or because of a vilified, we've rolled that out, she no longer has tremors.
[08:12] She still has multiple health conditions. She has no billical parniath that's returned.
[08:19] She has scoliosis. She has PTSD. She has depression. She has anxiety.
[08:27] I'm categorizing like I could go to myself and say what? While unintentional, like I just said,
[08:43] I could be manipulative. I could be gaslighting. I don't mean to be that way but it's how I see the truth
[08:50] than it frustrates me that she does not. I need to look for more of these triggers
[09:08] in these conversations and try to address them. I think if I try to address them all one time
[09:14] it will overwhelm me and I will forget I'll get lost
[09:22] and I'll go right back to the loop. I don't want that. So when I started off this morning
[09:31] my conversation with Caro and consisted of telling her that which our value her
[09:38] was. Telling her about the tactic about what we're self-worth. Telling her about the patterns. Telling her I know
[09:49] about my behaviors. I'm very aware of my behaviors but I don't know how to stop them and that I am working on.
[09:57] And that I believe she can do with anything she sets her mind to, regardless of her physical or mental
[10:02] handicaps. I would like to help her work on her blame shifting. I would like to know if I also do that
[10:20] if I'm also guilty of shifting the blame because if I am I don't see it.
[10:25] I still have 26 minutes before I get to work. One of the concessions I made last night was that
[10:40] she needed to go to work today and I have to be in the office, right? So I gave her $40 to get there.
[10:53] I can still pick her up tonight. I saw a little mantra or a little whatever you want to say.
[11:03] Call it. You remember you gave in the mantra. Anyway,
[11:09] to put myself in better alignment with abundance and flow.
[11:13] I have started using these affirmations would have you in addressing a higher power.
[11:25] While I will not call that power God, I recognize that that's probably what it is. That's probably what
[11:33] the rest of society is calling God. I have started to understand with affirmations and comparing
[11:42] to what prayers might look like. Coming in my mouth and how they might be genuine.
[11:50] Now they might be the same thing.
[11:54] I've decided to refer to quote unquote God as either player one or lord because sometimes it's
[12:06] fitting to say the word. I don't know why that is but it just seems like it's correct.
[12:19] I would like to recognize, and this is off the point completely, that I,
[12:28] man, I need a better word than pray or affirmation but I prayed yesterday in the car or I said
[12:34] affirmations and I expressed gratitude for the things that it did receive as I received them.
[12:45] And I looked for ways that those quote unquote prayers were answered.
[12:51] And I gave thanks every time that I recognized and I saw the gift of returning and putting me more
[13:00] up. Sometimes to myself, my head, sometimes out loud, but I didn't think anyone was listening.
[13:14] This is very hard. But I'm doing it now in the car because I only have this voice for
[13:23] quote that is listening, which is suspect, but that's all right because if I do, like I did with the
[13:31] conversation with Paul and the fight from last night, I think that these confessions, reflections
[13:41] could be extremely beneficial.
[13:47] So I know I don't want to work on everything at the same time. I know I just said that,
[13:52] but I don't want to hit stop and start all that. So I'm going to address another issue which is
[13:59] kind of the same issue. It's part of the bigger issue right now because of the fight that we had
[14:08] that's been going on for about a week now.
[14:10] Malau is not talking to Carolynn. She barely is talking to me, but that's all right because
[14:28] here's what I try to explain to Carolynn. It wasn't the boundary that sent
[14:36] Malau off. It was the statement after she accepted, after the boundary she tried to send
[14:45] of saying that she shouldn't bother. And she goes on to say she didn't know, but really you can read in
[14:52] the tone unless you're completely tone blind, which she might be. I might just be missing that.
[14:59] I over-tone and she is blind to tone, I think. So I think there's a disconnect there.
[15:12] But anyway, ultimately what happened was three days after Malau had told us both to hang ourselves.
[15:21] She, she told me three days later, she said in person. She scared herself a lot that just goes to show
[15:39] how far she was driven past the successes and the progress she's already made that had drove her to that
[15:50] point. I have told Carolynn that Malau's continued silence is her way of respecting boundaries and not
[16:04] triggering herself because she recognizes that Caro could be a trigger. And like me, she doesn't know how
[16:13] to deal with that. So I am trying to work with both of them and with myself. Angel seems to be fairly
[16:25] receptive to any direction I give her, which is nice. Even if she doesn't like it, I'm quick to tell her
[16:34] that I'm not coming out of a place of shame or blame or anything like that with her. If I tell her something
[16:46] for one, it is strictly confidential between the two of us. And the reason for that is the other two cannot
[16:54] handle the information, not in its raw on filter. So we have to understand. Sometimes I have to course
[17:07] Caro. Sometimes, for instance, last night in the chat, Angel was frustrated with a door dash driver
[17:17] and in the chat, wow, you know, with Caro and her cursing is in a big deal, right? But
[17:30] in Carolynn's generation, well, I'm at the end of Carolynn's generation. She's 1973, I'm 1979.
[17:37] So there's a little bit of a generation issue there. But I said to Angel, please in the chat, I
[17:50] recognize how comfortable you are with language and it isn't an issue for you and it isn't an issue for
[17:57] Mala. Work for most people. I recognize your restraint at work, how you respect the chain of command
[18:07] and you ask if you have permission to speak freely sometimes because things are frustrating.
[18:13] And you are an adult and that is perfect. That is the way to do that. However, in the chat between myself,
[18:22] her and Carolynn, because Mala is left the chat, that may be permanent, that may be temporary, we don't know.
[18:33] However, I would like her to keep a BG in the chat. It avoids the godly goodness understanding.
[18:44] And I just get a small request. After a brief puff, slight attempt to re-bundle from Angel and I have to
[18:59] go in this traffic circle again. I went to Angel and I said Angel, look, sometimes you have to sacrifice the battle.
[19:14] You have to lose the smaller fights in order for the greater goal.
[19:21] In this game of things, this battle is not important. What I would like you to do,
[19:30] may speak in age or sentence, it's hard like you to try to step back and recognize when fighting something.
[19:38] I need you to recognize that we are not even going to try to hold your back.
[19:52] If nothing else, I have not anyone to hold your back. I decided I made the decision to go to India
[20:01] to get you to bring you here, to change your path. That was my decision to make that final goal.
[20:09] I make no threats about sending you back to India, though Carolynn might try to do that, which we chose to power trip with that.
[20:19] I know how an efficient relationship is between her and Mala and I have seen the growth of Angel,
[20:27] since she's moved here. Since she's been here, she's got two jobs. One was her first job and it was like a
[20:38] practice job, that giant. Now she's working at Einstein bagels. She's working a lot in her hours,
[20:47] working consistently, doing things, trying more things, building confidence in herself.
[20:51] She's able to admit her truth to her family, whether her family accepts her or not,
[21:03] which she was not able to do. What she's not able to do is separate the behaviors of her stepmother.
[21:12] They want to add some purposes. May as well be a Disney stepmother.
[21:17] She falls into the stereotype. She also falls into the stereotype of Carolynn's parents, of being addicted to substance
[21:32] and conditioning in her previous experience before being a stepmother to Angel. So she's also a stepmother.
[21:40] So we all see the similarities, but comparing her to your stepmother is not helpful.
[21:51] Pivoting from that, I told Carolynn that your life is your own. Your traumas are your own.
[22:01] Don't maybe people don't fully understand, but I end even I will admit I don't have the same
[22:12] experiences that you do. So my PTSD is different than hers. That's different from Mallow's. Mallow's
[22:20] comes from the school where she was abused and raped. Mine comes from the manipulation of people
[22:27] that I thought were family. That we're not blood slamming. And some of them that were.
[22:34] Perus comes from a deeper, darker place of abuse from her family, from her parents who are now longer dead.
[22:41] Now both dead, but she's still honors even though it's weird. It's a weird juxtaposition where you honor the
[22:50] abuser. She has shrines as it were to her mom and her dad in the corner, which you know, respectfully,
[23:01] that's fine. That's that's her thing, but she doesn't recognize that by doing that and maybe I'm wrong.
[23:10] She's honoring the abusers. She's not allowing herself to grow.
[23:16] Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I'm wrong. That's part of why I'm recording this. I'm looking for my own
[23:25] patterns and things that I do and things that I say and how I could reframe them to come from a place
[23:31] of healing and support and growth and not from shame, blame, manipulation. Those places, the shame,
[23:42] blame and manipulation. Occasionally, not on purpose, but I will do. I think also for her are
[23:58] involuntary responses that she has developed in her fight or flight.
[24:07] Over time, being abused in relationships, family, what have you?
[24:22] I don't want to start. Sorry, I probably already started. I don't want to continue
[24:33] to go down the path that she tries to go. It's very difficult because I am the mirror
[24:42] that I try to hand people. Instead of just handing people the mirror, I become the mirror
[24:49] and sometimes that's helpful and sometimes it's not. But sometimes it's a trap for me.
[24:59] So, when she starts using these coping mechanisms, these responses, I mirror her and it's hard
[25:10] for me to get across that that's what I'm doing because I recognize it. But, Carolynn does not.
[25:20] So, when she hears that, and I'm mirroring her, she internalizes that. She takes it as an insult,
[25:31] as a slight, like, I'm not doing those things, you're doing those things. Going back to the blame shift.
[25:39] Whether she recognizes she's doing things or not, she has her own truth. As I tried to point out
[25:48] last night, everyone has their own truth. But the problem that I said last night was that she reviews
[25:56] as to acknowledge that any other truth could be true. I had to stay, had to rewind a statement that
[26:04] I made previously and I did to her and I said, in these arguments, you always have to be right.
[26:11] I said that statement was wrong. She was right to correct me that she doesn't have to be right.
[26:18] However, my belief is that she lives in a certain truth, non-deniable truth to her.
[26:29] She believes that it is what it is. The sky is blue, the grass is green. However,
[26:35] she's not open to the possibility, at least not in her current state, that there is another way
[26:45] that other people might actually have a point. So, another issue that I see is that
[26:57] going back to the PTSD, the trauma, the life experiences. She continues to let all of that define her as
[27:06] who she is. She is admitted, she does not love herself. She finds herself disgusting.
[27:16] But she also, as I am adding a note to that, is in a pit of despair.
[27:23] And she can't see outside of her. I am really trying to help her develop her own self-worth
[27:36] and self-love. And to me, that is more important than our relationship.
[27:44] Because our relationship, without that, since I am now beginning to love myself,
[27:51] beginning to value myself, I am standing up for myself. And I point at that out to her,
[27:58] without not standing up for me. I am not standing up for me. I am not standing up for her.
[28:03] I am standing up for myself, because I refuse to tolerate this kind of bullshit in our relationship.
[28:21] So, here's another one. Here's another one.
[28:34] Man, this is hard. Trying to find the words here.
[28:38] So, whoof. All right. So, our biggest issue, our biggest fight. Yes, money is a huge issue.
[28:54] We're working on that. We've named that with the bucket. At least you and I are.
[29:00] Is Malone. Whether she admits it or not, whether she's conscious of it or not,
[29:10] though I've tried to make her conscious, and she just deflects and deflects it.
[29:15] It was the one and her personal reflection time on this.
[29:19] Is that the way she expects me to handle it.
[29:22] The relationship with her and Malone is asked if I were both of their father.
[29:36] It's been pointed out to me by age, that Carolynn may be jealous of the relationship between Malone
[29:45] and Malone. So, because it's a relationship that she could not have with her father,
[29:51] she was robbed of having any chance in that.
[29:58] Carolynn refuses to see the truth in that.
[30:03] I see it completely, but I don't think it's the whole truth.
[30:08] These things are complicated. Like we said yesterday, she argues out of emotion.
[30:14] I argue out of emotion.
[30:18] And sometimes when I argue out of the object, since that's where I'm coming from,
[30:26] that's where I give no print. That's where I stand in my stance because I'm simply stating
[30:37] what we need to do. I've got a signing plan. She is internalizing the things that I say,
[30:46] and making them out of you, directing them.
[30:51] You know, as, as contemplations in herself.
[30:59] I don't know how to prank things other than this.
[31:00] So, when she's trying to get me to do something, get me to tell Malone something,
[31:11] and I think it's irrational because I know it will trigger Malone in the way that she wants to do it.
[31:20] I don't think she's hearing that. I don't think she's hearing that. I tried to ask her last night.
[31:31] If, who, of the two of you, she thinks if we're in compare, people, mentally,
[31:41] has their shit together. I knew the answer she was going to get, right? Even though I didn't agree
[31:47] with it. And she said herself. I said okay. I didn't disagree or fight that. I acted as if I believed
[31:57] that was the case. I said okay, well if that's the case, then you should be able to have compassion.
[32:08] You should be able to see from the other person's perspective. If you believe you are stronger
[32:15] in that capacity, then if someone acts out, you need to step away. You need to be the better person.
[32:23] Now, I'm not seeing you do that. So, there's a disconnect.
[32:34] Let that count that for a little while. Now, we have an issue. Tomorrow.
[32:43] Tomorrow, I am taking Alam to the OBGYN to talk about getting a top surgery and talk about getting a
[32:59] hysterectomy. And for a regular visit, these are things that she's wanted since she was 17, 18,
[33:08] since she knew that it was possible for these things to happen since they're causing her pain
[33:12] in her life, which is adding to her mental health issues because she can't control these things.
[33:21] And then I am a man. I don't really understand what I'm doing the best that I can to help her out somewhere.
[33:29] The problem with that is that at 11.30, I need to drive Carolynn to work.
[33:37] Today, I've given her a lot of money. Tomorrow, I will take her to work.
[33:46] And Mallow's appointment is in front of you.
[33:52] So, it would make sense if we could all be in the car together.
[33:58] We're going to need to all be in the car together.
[34:00] Tomorrow, tomorrow is not Friday. Mallow has already said that on Friday, things will be fine.
[34:10] She will keep to herself. If I can keep Carolynn stable, we can do our thing, they can do their thing.
[34:20] I need to have a conversation with her tonight to see if that's possible. Tomorrow,
[34:26] because Carolynn's work is not very far away.
[34:30] And her appointment is not very far away. But in doubling back, we may be late.
[34:40] So, I think she will see the sense in that. But I have until seven o'clock tonight when I pick up
[34:51] Carolynn to work. To get that point across.
[34:58] Wish me luck. I'm almost at work now.
[35:06] So, I'm going to end this recording.
[35:13] Thank you for listening.
