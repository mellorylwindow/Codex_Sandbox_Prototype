[25:31] as a slight, like, I'm not doing those things, you're doing those things. Going back to the blame shift.
[25:39] Whether she recognizes she's doing things or not, she has her own truth. As I tried to point out
[25:48] last night, everyone has their own truth. But the problem that I said last night was that she reviews
[25:56] as to acknowledge that any other truth could be true. I had to stay, had to rewind a statement that
[26:04] I made previously and I did to her and I said, in these arguments, you always have to be right.
[26:11] I said that statement was wrong. She was right to correct me that she doesn't have to be right.
[26:18] However, my belief is that she lives in a certain truth, non-deniable truth to her.
[26:29] She believes that it is what it is. The sky is blue, the grass is green. However,
[26:35] she's not open to the possibility, at least not in her current state, that there is another way
[26:45] that other people might actually have a point. So, another issue that I see is that
[26:57] going back to the PTSD, the trauma, the life experiences. She continues to let all of that define her as
[27:06] who she is. She is admitted, she does not love herself. She finds herself disgusting.
[27:16] But she also, as I am adding a note to that, is in a pit of despair.
[27:23] And she can't see outside of her. I am really trying to help her develop her own self-worth
[27:36] and self-love. And to me, that is more important than our relationship.
[27:44] Because our relationship, without that, since I am now beginning to love myself,
[27:51] beginning to value myself, I am standing up for myself. And I point at that out to her,
[27:58] without not standing up for me. I am not standing up for me. I am not standing up for her.
[28:03] I am standing up for myself, because I refuse to tolerate this kind of bullshit in our relationship.
[28:21] So, here's another one. Here's another one.
[28:34] Man, this is hard. Trying to find the words here.
[28:38] So, whoof. All right. So, our biggest issue, our biggest fight. Yes, money is a huge issue.
[28:54] We're working on that. We've named that with the bucket. At least you and I are.
[29:00] Is Malone. Whether she admits it or not, whether she's conscious of it or not,
[29:10] though I've tried to make her conscious, and she just deflects and deflects it.
[29:15] It was the one and her personal reflection time on this.
[29:19] Is that the way she expects me to handle it.
[29:22] The relationship with her and Malone is asked if I were both of their father.
[29:36] It's been pointed out to me by age, that Carolynn may be jealous of the relationship between Malone
[29:45] and Malone. So, because it's a relationship that she could not have with her father,
[29:51] she was robbed of having any chance in that.
[29:58] Carolynn refuses to see the truth in that.
[30:03] I see it completely, but I don't think it's the whole truth.
[30:08] These things are complicated. Like we said yesterday, she argues out of emotion.
[30:14] I argue out of emotion.
[30:18] And sometimes when I argue out of the object, since that's where I'm coming from,
[30:26] that's where I give no print. That's where I stand in my stance because I'm simply stating
